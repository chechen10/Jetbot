## Task 1: Manual Controlled Racing
For the first race, we will finish three loops using manual control. Instand of control Buttons, we will use Gamepad Controller and change a little bit from
the recommend codes.
You can find that we did not use the joystick of the Gamepad Controller, instead we used the trigger, the left and right directional keys for control.
The left and right triggers represent reverse and forward, and the left and right directional keys represent turn.
The advantage of this method is that the speed of the Jetbot will become very fast on straight roads, and the maneuverability on bends is much better than the joystick method.
