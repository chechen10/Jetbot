## Road Following - Test 2 

For test 2, we can do the full circuit only by using the road following part.
We put the model"best_steering_model_xy_trt.pth" and code file "Task2.ipynb" in the same location for test.
Before the test, we adjusted values for the speed and the steering gain, which can make the Jetbot drive along the road more accurately. You can adjust the value by checking the data output.

Basically, Jetbot can excellently meet the requirements of TASK2. You can view the live demo through the link below.
