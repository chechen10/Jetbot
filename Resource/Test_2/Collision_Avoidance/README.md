## Collision Avoidance

For Collision Avoidance, we can use the model which is trained on the track, the model will identify the object and the jet will automatically avoid to the left.
We can see when there is no object in front of the Jetbot, the value of "blocked" is low.
If there is an object in front, the value of "blocked" will increase above 0.8 and the Jetbot will automatically avoid.
